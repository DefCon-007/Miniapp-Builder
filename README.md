# Seam Block SDK
### ðŸš§ NOTE: This SDK is in active development ðŸš§

Seam is a community-developed platform to code, design, and curate your perfect social spaces.

# Quickstart

1. git clone the repo
2. `yarn install`
3. `sudo ./seam-magic.sh` will guide you through creating a template of an empty block, given whatever name you choose!
4. `yarn start` to see your new block in action.


# Block Submission
Once your block is looking good, it's time to create a pull request so your block can go live on the [seam.so](www.seam.so) site!

# Q&A
- My block needs a dependency. How should I include it?
- My block needs an external API key. How do I make it work?
