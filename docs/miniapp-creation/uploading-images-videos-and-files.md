# Uploading Images, Videos, and Files

We provide a file upload service that you can use to upload any files your miniapp will need. To use it, just import the `FileUploadComponent` in your edit modal. Check out the `VideoBlock` as an example. The strategy is 1) use the upload component to upload, and then 2) store the URL in your block. TADA! You're done, that's all you need to upload any file! Try it with audio files, pdfs, videos, ect. Have fun!
