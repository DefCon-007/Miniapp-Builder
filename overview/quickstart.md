1. git clone the repo, `cd Miniapp-Builder`
2. `yarn install`
3. `./seam-magic.sh` will guide you through creating a template of an empty miniapp, given whatever name you choose! If this doesn't work for you (Windows users), see below for instructions on how to set up the SDK manually.
4. `yarn start` to see your new miniapp in action.
