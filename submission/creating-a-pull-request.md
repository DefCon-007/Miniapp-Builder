# Creating a Pull Request

Once you are happy with your miniapp, it's time to create a pull request so your miniapp can go live on [seam.so](https://www.seam.so) and the Seam mobile app.

#### Before you Submit

To help your pull request go as smoothly as possible, review the steps listed below that can slow down a review. Make sure you:

* Test your miniapp for crashes and bugs
* Remove all `console.log` statements, commented code, and unused code. Remember, your block will live open source as an example for new developers who come behind you!
* Make a Seam profile so that we know who to credit
* Don't include any large new dependencies that would slow down the entire Seam loading experience

#### Making the Submission

For easiest review, please format the title of your pull request like so:

* Title: \[Miniapp Submission]: Name of miniapp

Then in the body, make sure to have these sections:

* Photos! We want to see your miniapp in action.
* Author: Seam username, Twitter handle if you have one so we can include you in our block release tweets
* Seam username. This is how we can credit you!
* Summary: What does your miniapp do?
* Remixes: Did you remix or copy code from another miniapp? Which ones?

We'll accept any miniapps that are genuine and fun and come from your own imagination. We strongly support all points of view being represented on Seam, as long as the miniapps are respectful to users with differing opinions and the quality of the miniapp is great. We won't merge any miniapps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line.
